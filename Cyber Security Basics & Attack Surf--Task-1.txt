Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface – Task 1
1. Introduction to Cyber Security

Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks usually aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money, or disrupt normal business operations.

In today’s digital world, cyber security is critical for applications such as online banking, social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and cloud services.

2. CIA Triad (Core Principles of Cyber Security)

The CIA Triad represents the three fundamental goals of cyber security:

2.1 Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.

Examples:

Banking apps protecting account details with passwords and encryption

WhatsApp using end-to-end encryption for messages

Techniques used:

Encryption

Authentication

Access control

2.2 Integrity

Integrity ensures that data is accurate, complete, and not altered without authorization.

Examples:

Transaction amounts in banking systems

Exam results stored in university databases

Techniques used:

Hashing

Digital signatures

Checksums

2.3 Availability

Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed.

Examples:

ATM services available 24/7

Email servers running without interruption

Threats to availability:

DDoS attacks

Server failures

Ransomware

3. Types of Cyber Attackers
3.1 Script Kiddies

Beginners with limited technical knowledge

Use ready-made tools and scripts

Motivated by curiosity or fun

3.2 Insiders

Employees or trusted users

May intentionally or unintentionally cause harm

Very dangerous due to legitimate access

3.3 Hacktivists

Attack for political or social reasons

Target governments or organizations

Examples: website defacement, data leaks

3.4 Nation-State Attackers

Sponsored by governments

Highly skilled and well-funded

Focus on espionage, cyber warfare, and infrastructure attacks

4. Attack Surface

An attack surface is the total number of points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data from a system.

Common Attack Surfaces:

Web applications

Mobile applications

APIs

Networks

Cloud infrastructure

Databases

Reducing the attack surface lowers the risk of attacks.

5. OWASP Top 10 Overview

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks.

Common OWASP Vulnerabilities:

Broken Access Control

Cryptographic Failures

Injection (SQL Injection, Command Injection)

Insecure Design

Security Misconfiguration

Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Identification and Authentication Failures

Software and Data Integrity Failures

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Why they are dangerous:
They allow attackers to steal data, bypass authentication, execute commands, or completely compromise systems.

6. Mapping Daily-Use Applications to Attack Surfaces
Example: Email Application

Attack Surface: Web interface, login page, SMTP server

Possible Attacks: Phishing, credential theft, malware attachments

Example: Banking App

Attack Surface: Mobile app, API, database

Possible Attacks: Man-in-the-middle, SQL injection, credential stuffing

7. Data Flow in an Application

Typical Data Flow:
User → Application (Web/Mobile) → Server → Database

Possible Attack Points:

User side: Phishing, malware

Application layer: XSS, injection attacks

Server: Misconfiguration, outdated software

Database: Unauthorized access, data leakage

8. Vulnerability vs Threat vs Risk

Vulnerability: A weakness in a system (e.g., weak password)

Threat: A potential danger that exploits a vulnerability (e.g., hacker)

Risk: The impact and likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

9. Importance of OWASP Top 10

Acts as a security awareness standard

Helps developers build secure applications

Reduces common and critical security risks

Widely accepted by the security industry

10. Conclusion

This task provided a strong foundation in cyber security concepts. Understanding the CIA triad, attack surfaces, attacker types, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities is essential for identifying threats and protecting systems. These fundamentals are critical for anyone pursuing a career in cyber security.
